# Agent Ownership Experience Update

## Overview

Updated the agent store and chat experience to properly reflect agent ownership status throughout the application. Users who own agents (either through minting prebuilt agents or creating personal agents) now see appropriate controls and access levels instead of "try free version" prompts.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Agent Store API (`/api/agent-store/route.ts`)

**Improved Ownership Detection:**

```typescript
// Enhanced ownership detection for prebuilt agents
isOwned: userWallet && (
  // User minted this prebuilt agent
  (agent.is_minted && agent.owner_wallet === userWallet) ||
  // User is the creator of this deployed personal agent
  (agent.original_agent_id && agent.creator_wallet === userWallet)
),

// User always owns their own minted agents
isOwned: userWallet === agent.creator_wallet_address,
```

### 2. Updated Agent Cards (`EnhancedAgentCard.tsx`)

**Ownership-Based Badges:**

- **"Owned"** badge (green) - When user owns the agent
- **"Minted"** badge (blue) - When agent is minted but not owned by user
- **"Premium"** badge (purple) - For agents with premium features
- **"Featured"** badge (yellow) - For top featured agents

**Dynamic Action Buttons:**

- **Owned agents**: "Use Agent" button (blue) for direct access
- **Non-owned agents**: "Try Free Version" button (green) for limited access

**Link Text Updates:**

- **Owned agents**: "Manage Agent"
- **Minted by others**: "View Details"
- **Not minted**: "Explore Agent"

### 3. Enhanced Agent Detail Page (`/agent-store/[id]/page.tsx`)

**Ownership-Based Interface:**

**For Owned Agents:**

- "Use Agent" button for full access
- Green success panel: "ðŸŽ‰ You Own This Agent!"
- "Full premium access unlocked" message

**For Non-Owned Agents:**

- "Try Free Version" button
- Standard minting flow for unminted agents
- "ðŸ”’ Already Minted by Others" for minted but not owned agents

**Capability Access:**

- **Premium features**: "Use Feature" for owned agents, "Requires Ownership" for non-owned
- **Free features**: Always available with "Try Demo"

### 4. Updated Chat Experience (`ChatModal.tsx`)

**Ownership-Aware Chat Interface:**

**Header Status:**

- **Owned**: "Premium Access" with green checkmark
- **Not owned**: "Try Free Version"

**Footer Status:**

- **Owned**: "Premium access â€¢ Full features unlocked"
- **Not owned**: "Free version â€¢ Limited features"

**Initial Greeting:**

- **Owned**: "As an owner, you have full access to all my premium features and capabilities!"
- **Not owned**: "You're currently using the free version with limited features. Consider minting me as an NFT to unlock my full potential!"

**Chat API Integration:**

- Sends `isPremium: isOwned` flag
- Owned agents get longer response limits and better capabilities

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: User Owns Agent

1. **Agent Store**: Shows "Owned" badge and "Use Agent" button
2. **Agent Detail**: Shows ownership confirmation and "Use Agent" access
3. **Chat**: Full premium experience with extended capabilities
4. **Features**: All premium features unlocked

### Scenario 2: User Doesn't Own Agent

1. **Agent Store**: Shows appropriate badge and "Try Free Version" button
2. **Agent Detail**: Shows minting options (if available) and limited access
3. **Chat**: Limited free experience with upgrade prompts
4. **Features**: Only free features available, premium locked

### Scenario 3: Agent Minted by Others

1. **Agent Store**: Shows "Minted" badge indicating unavailability
2. **Agent Detail**: Clear indication that agent is owned by others
3. **Chat**: Free version only
4. **Features**: Limited access, no minting option

## Technical Benefits

âœ… **Clear Ownership Indication**: Users always know their access level
âœ… **Consistent Experience**: Ownership status reflected across all pages
âœ… **Appropriate Access Control**: Premium features locked behind ownership
âœ… **Better User Flow**: No confusion about capabilities and access
âœ… **Enhanced Value Proposition**: Clear benefits of owning vs trying free

## Key Features

- **Smart Badge System**: Visual indicators for ownership status
- **Context-Aware Actions**: Buttons and links adapt to user's relationship with agent
- **Premium Experience**: Owned agents provide full access without limitations
- **Upgrade Prompts**: Free users see clear path to unlock premium features
- **Ownership Verification**: Robust backend logic to determine true ownership

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Create personal agent** â†’ Should show "Owned" status everywhere
2. **Mint prebuilt agent** â†’ Should unlock premium access immediately
3. **View agent owned by others** â†’ Should show limited access appropriately
4. **Deploy personal agent to store** â†’ Should maintain ownership in store context

The update ensures that agent ownership is a first-class concept throughout the application, providing clear value to users who invest in minting agents while still offering meaningful free access to others.
