# Agent User-Specific Ownership Fix

## Critical Issue Identified

The agent store was incorrectly showing "Owned" badges and premium access to ALL users for agents that were minted by ANY user, instead of only showing this to the user who actually minted the agent.

### The Problem

**Before the fix:**

- User A mints Agent X â†’ Agent X gets `isMinted: true`
- User B visits the store â†’ Sees Agent X with "Owned" badge and "Use Agent" button
- User B gets premium access to Agent X even though they didn't pay for it
- **Result**: Free users were getting premium access to agents they didn't own

### Root Cause

1. **API Logic Issue**: The `isMinted` field was set to `true` for ALL users when ANY user minted an agent
2. **Frontend Logic Issue**: Components used `isMinted: true` to determine ownership, regardless of WHO minted it

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed API Ownership Logic (`/api/agent-store/route.ts`)

**Before (WRONG):**

```typescript
// For prebuilt agents
isMinted: agent.is_minted || false, // True for everyone if anyone minted it

// For minted agents
isMinted: true, // Always true for all users
```

**After (CORRECT):**

```typescript
// For prebuilt agents - only true if CURRENT USER minted it
isMinted: userWallet && agent.is_minted && agent.owner_wallet === userWallet,

// For minted agents - only true if CURRENT USER created it
isMinted: userWallet === agent.creator_wallet_address,

// Track when minted by others for proper badges
isMintedByOthers: agent.is_minted && (!userWallet || agent.owner_wallet !== userWallet),
```

### 2. Enhanced Badge System (`EnhancedAgentCard.tsx`)

**New Badge Logic:**

- **"Owned" (Green)**: User personally minted/owns this agent â†’ Full premium access
- **"Minted" (Blue)**: Someone else minted this agent â†’ Limited free access only
- **"Premium" (Purple)**: Unminted agent with premium features â†’ Free trial + minting option
- **"Featured" (Yellow)**: Top featured agents â†’ Standard access

### 3. Updated Agent Detail Page (`/agent-store/[id]/page.tsx`)

**Three Distinct User Experiences:**

**For User-Owned Agents:**

```
ðŸŽ‰ You Own This Agent!
[Use Agent] (Full premium access)
```

**For Agents Minted by Others:**

```
ðŸ”’ Already Minted by Another User
[Try Free Version] (Limited access only)
```

**For Unminted Agents:**

```
[Try Free Version] + [Mint Agent NFT]
```

### 4. Enhanced Type Safety (`types/agent.ts`)

Added `isMintedByOthers?: boolean` field to distinguish between:

- `isMinted: true` = "I own this agent"
- `isMintedByOthers: true` = "Someone else owns this agent"

## User Experience Now

### âœ… User A (Minted Agent X):

- Sees Agent X with green "Owned" badge
- Gets "Use Agent" button with full premium access
- Can use all premium features without restrictions
- Sees "ðŸŽ‰ You Own This Agent!" confirmation

### âœ… User B (Different User):

- Sees Agent X with blue "Minted" badge
- Gets "Try Free Version" button only
- Limited to free features only
- Sees "ðŸ”’ Already Minted by Another User" message
- Cannot access premium features without minting their own agent

### âœ… Everyone (Unminted Agents):

- Sees "Premium" or "Featured" badges
- Gets "Try Free Version" + "Mint Agent NFT" options
- Can mint to gain ownership and premium access

## Technical Implementation

### User-Specific API Calls

```typescript
// Agent store now requires user wallet for proper ownership
const url =
  connected && publicKey
    ? `/api/agent-store?user_wallet=${encodeURIComponent(publicKey.toString())}`
    : `/api/agent-store`;
```

### Universal Ownership Check Pattern

```typescript
// Use this pattern consistently throughout the app
const userOwnsAgent = (connected && agent.isOwned) || agent.isMinted;

// For premium access, use:
if (userOwnsAgent) {
  // Show premium features
} else {
  // Show free/limited features
}
```

## Security & Business Impact

### âœ… Prevents Revenue Loss

- Users can no longer access premium features without paying
- Each user must mint their own agent to get premium access
- Proper monetization of agent capabilities

### âœ… Ensures Fair Access Control

- Only paying customers get premium features
- Free users get appropriate limited access
- Clear distinction between owned vs. unowned agents

### âœ… Proper User Experience

- No confusion about ownership status
- Clear visual indicators for different access levels
- Prevents false "owned" expectations

## Verification Steps

1. **User A mints Agent X**

   - âœ… Should see green "Owned" badge
   - âœ… Should get "Use Agent" button
   - âœ… Should have full premium access

2. **User B views same Agent X**

   - âœ… Should see blue "Minted" badge
   - âœ… Should get "Try Free Version" button only
   - âœ… Should NOT have premium access
   - âœ… Should see "Already Minted by Another User" message

3. **Both users view unminted Agent Y**
   - âœ… Should see "Premium" badge
   - âœ… Should get minting option
   - âœ… Should have free trial access

## Conclusion

This fix resolves a critical business logic flaw where users were getting premium access without payment. Now each user's ownership is properly tracked and enforced, ensuring:

- **Proper monetization**: Only paying users get premium features
- **Clear ownership**: Visual indicators match actual ownership
- **Fair access control**: No unintended premium access
- **Correct user experience**: Appropriate buttons and messaging for each user's relationship to each agent

The system now correctly distinguishes between "I own this agent" vs "someone else owns this agent" vs "this agent is available for minting."
